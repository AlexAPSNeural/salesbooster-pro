Creating a template for environment variables is crucial for managing different configurations across various environments such as development, testing, staging, and production. Here's a basic template for a `.env` file, which is commonly used in Node.js applications. You can adapt it based on your application's requirements:

```plaintext
# Server settings
PORT=3000
HOST=localhost

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=my_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=my_secure_password
DB_NAME=my_database

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=my_super_secret_jwt_key
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=my_oauth_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=my_oauth_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=my_session_secret

# API keys
API_KEY_SERVICE_ONE=your_service_one_api_key
API_KEY_SERVICE_TWO=your_service_two_api_key

# Email server credentials
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=my_email_user
EMAIL_PASSWORD=my_email_password

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Feature flags
FEATURE_X_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_Y_ENABLED=false

# CDN and asset management
CDN_URL=https://cdn.example.com

# Others
TIMEZONE=UTC
CACHE_TTL=3600
```

### Usage Notes:
- **Port and Host:** Set the host and port for your server depending on the environment.
- **Database Configuration:** Replace with your actual database credentials.
- **Authentication:** Ensure that JWT secrets and OAuth credentials are unique and secure.
- **API Keys:** Add any keys for third-party services your application uses.
- **Email Server:** Configured for sending application emails.
- **Logging:** Log level can be adjusted to `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.
- **Feature Flags:** Manage experimental or optional features easily.
- **CDN:** If you are using a content delivery network for static assets.
- **Others:** Adjust time zones and caching strategies as needed.

### Security Notes:
- **Do not commit the `.env` file to version control.** Use `.gitignore` to exclude it, and share it securely with your team.
- **Consider using environment variable management solutions** like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault in production for better security practices.

Make sure to customize each variable as per your specific project and deployment requirements.
